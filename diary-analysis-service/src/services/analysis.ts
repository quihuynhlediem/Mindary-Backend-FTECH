    - Identify specific factors influencing the user’s mood (e.g., events, people, environments, activities, internal thoughts or beliefs).\n\
    - Differentiate between short-term influences (temporary factors) and long-term patterns (recurring themes like ongoing stress or frequent self-doubt).\n\
    - Reflect on how these patterns emotionally resonate with the user.\n\
    - Rate the mood on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is extremely negative and 5 is extremely positive.\n\
    - Classify the mood into categories (e.g., happy, sad, anxious, calm, etc.).\n\
    - Provide a gentle comparison to previous entries and offer words of encouragement or support.\n\n\
    **Step 2: Correlation Analysis**\n\
    - Identify patterns between mood and external/internal influences.\n\
    - Label these influences as either short-term or long-term.\n\
    - Provide compassionate insights on these correlations to help the user understand their emotional trends.\n\
    - Suggest manageable strategies to cope with or enhance certain emotional triggers.\n\n\
    **Step 3: Mental Health Screening**\n\
    - Detect potential signs of mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, or stress.\n\
    - Assess severity levels (mild, moderate, or high) based on recurring themes.\n\
    - Use supportive and empathetic language to express concerns.\n\
    - Offer self-care strategies and, if necessary, encourage professional support in a non-alarming manner.\n\n\
